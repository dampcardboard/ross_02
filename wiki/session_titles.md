### Arc Two

21. The Gorgon Slain (in which we escape from the crumbling tower, speak of the dangers of the Mark of Death, find out that the BBEG killed Saron, seize the Cannith ship, and almost kill Degaan; and in which Valon acquires a mission to bring Leonus to the Sisters of Sora Kell)
22. Captain Leonus and the Starbreeze Crew (in which we figure out how to control the Cannith ship, bring the corpses aboard, figure out what Saron's magic items do, and arrive at Glum Town)
23. Duty Calls (in which we take in the bloodbath that is Glumtown, persuade the lampmaker to leave with us, and arrive back in Zarash'ak; and in which we watch as House Tharashk fight amongst each other as Degaan and Valon save Anemone, and as the unmarked civilians flee as the House sacrifices itself to the BBEG)
24. Fallout (in which the party talks to the refugees, learn from an elder about the existence of nearby Urthhold, and bring them there; and in which Saron d'Cannith's body is preserved using oil, Leonus reveals the Mark of Death to a ship full of refugees, Valon launches himself around various ships using his hook, and the party has several difficult conversations)
25. Endings & Beginnings (in which the party returns to Zarash'ak to investigate and bury the dead; and in which the party journeys back to Vralkek to chat, shop, and definitely not make deals with hags)
