## Eberron: Ashes of the Last War

Hi there! If you're here, you're part of Ross's Eberron game. Alternatively, you've somehow stumbled upon the wrong website. Either way, welcome! Sentient robots, soaring airships, and a continent torn apart by a hundred years of terrible warfare await you. Also, strange goblinoid ruins and miscolored dragonshards!

### Useful Links

Here's the [notepad of info](https://tinyurl.com/y3wsxjxm) for the game so far. Here's the [session zero document](https://tinyurl.com/sunday-ashes).

Here's [Degaan Torn's character sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1r06QlHHSuBoXNak64GXcZtpkFyH3kIKz/view), who's accompanying us right now.
