## Eberron: Ashes of the Last War

![Mark of Scribing.png]({{site.baseurl}}/wiki/Mark of Scribing.png)

Hi there! If you're here, you're part of Ross's Eberron game. Alternatively, you've somehow stumbled upon the wrong website. Either way, welcome! Sentient robots, soaring airships, and a continent torn apart by a hundred years of terrible warfare await you. Also: strange goblinoid ruins, mysterious dragonshards, and a monster powered by the planes of life and madness!

### Houserules

**Gritty Realism.** This variant uses a short rest of 8 hours and a long rest of 7 days. (DMG, p. 267.)

**Dragonshards and Resource Regeneration.** You can use 1 pound of Red Dragonshards to regain a 1st-level spell slot or a feature/trait that takes a short rest to recover, 2 pounds for a 2nd-level spell slot, 3 pounds for a 3rd-level spell slot or a feature/trait that takes a long rest to recover, and so on with higher-level spell slots. You can do this with the Use an Item action, provided you have the requisite amount of Eberron/Red Dragonshards. If you "consume" more pounds of these dragonshards per day than your proficiency bonus, you'll suffer magic poisoning, which has varying effects that grow more severe the further past your limit that you push. (Ross, d. 2020-02-12.)

**Per-day Abilities.** All class and race features that say "once per day" or something similar come back only on long rests or when recovered using red dragonshards. However, Dragonmark and magic item abilities work as written, usually regaining their magics each day at dawn. (Ross, d. 2020-12-16.)

**Hit Dice Recovery.** After a long rest, characters recover all their hit dice, instead of half. (Ross, d. 2021-01-03.)
