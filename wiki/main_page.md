## Eberron: Ashes of the Last War

Hi there! If you're here, you're part of Ross's Eberron game. Alternatively, you've somehow stumbled upon the wrong website. Either way, welcome! Sentient robots, soaring airships, and a continent torn apart by a hundred years of terrible warfare await you. Also, strange goblinoid ruins and miscolored dragonshards!

Alphabetically, the current players are: Angela, June, Mat√≠as, and Will. Their characters are, respectively:

* Pepper Thistlehedge, Lightfoot Halfling Bard 5 (College of Glamour)
* Anemone d'Lyrandar, Half-elf Wizard 5 (War Magic)
* Leonus Zecrum, Stout Halfling Accursed 5 (Curse of the Plague)
* Valon Woodsrow, Wood Elf Druid 5 (Circle of the Bond)

Two other players, Rich and Ronnie, have left us. Their characters were, respectively:

* Arend Thul, Half-elf Sculptor 4 (Shape of the Axe)
* Milo Hawkins, Lightfoot Halfling Rogue 4 (Swashbuckler)
